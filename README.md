## Project Overview

Organisations routinely need to back up files under storage constraints and then recover the most valuable files after a data-loss event.  
This project models exactly that scenario:

| Phase | Problem | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| 1 – Backup | Which files to back up within limited storage? | Greedy algorithm sorted by priority |
| 2 – Recovery | Which backed-up lost files to restore within bandwidth limits? | 0/1 Knapsack via Dynamic Programming |

---

## Features

- **File dataset** – 15-file default dataset or interactive custom input  
- **Risk-weighted priority** – `priority = importance × risk / size`  
- **Greedy backup selection** – O(n log n) sort then linear scan  
- **Loss simulation** – random (seed-controlled) or predefined file IDs  
- **DP recovery optimisation** – guaranteed optimal recovery within bandwidth  
- **Detailed console output** – tables, summaries, percentage metrics  
- **Unit tests** – no external framework required

## Algorithms Explained

### Priority Formula

```
priority = (importance × risk) / size
```

| Factor | Role |
|--------|------|
| `importance` (1–10) | How critical the file is to operations |
| `risk` (0.0–1.0) | Probability that the file will be lost without backup |
| `size` (MB) | Storage cost — penalises large files |

**Rationale:** A file that is highly important, likely to be lost, *and* small is the best candidate for backup. Dividing by size ensures the metric represents "value per megabyte" — exactly the greedy knapsack density heuristic.

**Integer value for DP:**  
`value = round(importance × risk × 100)`  
Scaling by 100 preserves fractional differences without floating-point DP.

---

### Phase 1 – Greedy Backup Selection

**Why Greedy?**

The backup selection problem is a variant of the 0/1 Knapsack problem (storage capacity is the knapsack weight).  
The exact DP solution is O(n × W), which becomes slow when n is large or W is a large floating-point number.

The greedy approach:
1. Compute `priority = importance × risk / size` for every file.
2. Sort files in **descending priority** order — O(n log n).
3. Iterate through the sorted list; select a file if it fits within remaining capacity.

This runs in O(n log n) and yields near-optimal results because:
- Files with the highest "bang per byte" are always preferred.
- The priority ratio naturally balances value against storage cost.
- In practice, greedy for fractional knapsack is **optimal**; for 0/1 knapsack it is a fast, well-accepted heuristic.

**Trade-off:** Greedy is not guaranteed to be globally optimal for 0/1 knapsack (where items cannot be split), but for real backup workloads the approximation quality is excellent and the speed benefit is significant.

---

### Phase 2 – DP Recovery Optimisation

**Why Dynamic Programming?**

After a loss event, recovery also has a constraint: recovery bandwidth (MB that can be transferred back from backup in the available time window).  
This is a *classic* 0/1 Knapsack problem where:

| Knapsack term | Backup meaning |
|---------------|----------------|
| Items | Backed-up files that were also lost |
| Weight | File size (bandwidth consumed during recovery) |
| Value | `round(importance × risk × 100)` |
| Capacity | Recovery bandwidth limit (MB) |

DP guarantees the **globally optimal** recovery selection in O(n × W) time.  
Unlike the backup phase (where speed dominates and greedy is acceptable), the recovery phase is a one-time decision where **maximising recovered value** is paramount.

**DP Recurrence:**

```
dp[i][w] = max value using the first i files with w MB of bandwidth remaining

dp[i][w] = max(
    dp[i-1][w],                         // skip file i
    dp[i-1][w - size_i] + value_i       // recover file i (if size_i ≤ w)
)

Base case: dp[0][w] = 0 for all w
```

After filling the table, back-tracking from `dp[n][W]` identifies exactly which files to recover.

**Size scaling:** File sizes are multiplied by 10 and rounded to integers, giving 0.1 MB resolution in the DP table while keeping weights integral.
